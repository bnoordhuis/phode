This is the new networking layer for Node. Its purpose is to abstract
IOCP on windows and libev on Unix systems. We intend to eventually contain
all platform differences in this library.

= Build Instructions

For GCC (including MinGW) there are two methods building: via normal
makefiles or via GYP. GYP is a meta-build system which can generate MSVS,
Makefile, and XCode backends. It is best used for integration into other
projects.  The old (more stable) system is using Makefiles.

To build via Makefile simply execute:

    make

To build with Visual Studio run the vcbuilds.bat file which will
checkout the GYP code into build/gyp and generate the uv.sln and
related files.

Windows users can also build from cmd-line using msbuild.  This is 
done by running vcbuild.bat from Visual Studio command prompt.

To have GYP generate build script for another system you will need to
checkout GYP into the project tree manually:

    svn co http://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk build/gyp

Unix users run

    ./gyp_uv -f make
    make

Macintosh users run

    ./gyp_uv -f xcode
    xcodebuild -project uv.xcodeproj -configuration Release -target All


= Supported Platforms

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows XP SP2. It can be built
with either Visual Studio or MinGW.

Linux 2.6 using the GCC toolchain.

MacOS using the GCC or XCode toolchain.

Solaris 121 and later using GCC toolchain.
