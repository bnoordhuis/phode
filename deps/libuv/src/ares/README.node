Notes:

Just use waf instead of the autoconf based configure script. Delete most of
the documentation and other files distributed with it. To upgrade, run
./configure on linux, macintosh, solaris (and other supported platforms) and
copy
- ares_config.h
- ares_setup.h
- ares_build.h
into the appropriate directory.
